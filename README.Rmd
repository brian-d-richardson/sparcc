```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Installation 

Installation of `sparcc` from GitHub requires the [`devtools`](https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/pandoc/devtools.html) package and can be done with the following code: 

```{r, eval = F}
# install the package
devtools::install_github(repo = "brian-d-richardson/sparcc", 
                         ref = "main")
```
```{r}
# load the package
library(sparcc)
```

The `sparcc` package contains functions to analyze data with a random right censored covariate using a semiparametric method. The methods implemented are introduced in the paper, "Doubly robust estimation under a random right censored covariate," which is currently in progress.
